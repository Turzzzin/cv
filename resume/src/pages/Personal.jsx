          <h1>Hi, I'm Artur ðŸ‘‹</h1>
          <p>Welcome to my website. Here you'll find a little bit about me.</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about programming, music, and gaming â€” three things that shape a big part of my life.  
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy building programming projects (like this one you're reading right now!) or creating little tools to make my life easier.  
          </p>

          <p>
            Music is also a huge part of my daily routine. Whether Iâ€™m working, working out, gaming, or just chatting with friends, I love having a good playlist in the background.  
          </p>

          <p>
            Gaming has been a big hobby for me as well. I was once among the top 500 VALORANT players on the Brazil server and even did some streaming before starting college. These days, Iâ€™m more of a casual player, but I still enjoy the game whenever I can.  
          </p>

          <p>
            And of course, nothing beats spending quality time with my friends and family.
